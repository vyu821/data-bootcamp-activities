This dataset includes hotel reviews for roughly 2,000 hotels throughout the world. There may be multiple reviews for each hotel. 

This dataset is maintained by data.world.

Today's class will be a case study where we have been hired by Blue Sky Private Equity to help them better understand their hotel review data from hotels in their portfolio.

Our dataset for this case study has numerous reviews for the hotels in their portfolio.

### 1. Instructor Do: Introduce Reviews Dataset

* The goal of our analysis today is helping Blue Sky Private Equity better understand their customer reviews, and ultimately relay that information to the management of those locations. We'll start by looking at a dataset with reviews from each hotel. We will need to clean it up a little bit before we can use it for our analysis. We will then use Natural Language Processing for our analysis.

### 2. Instructor Do: Importing Reviews into DataFrame

* After we've introduced the dataset to students, it is important to import the reviews into a PySpark DataFrame. Show students how to get their PySpark working and import the dataset from CSV into a DataFrame.

### 3. Instructor Do: Tokenize Reviews

* Our goal with this activity is to show students what tokenization is, how to use it, and what the value of it is.

### 4. Instructor Do: User Defined Functions

* Our goal with this activity is to help students understand what a user defined function is in PySpark. Show students how to create a function which gets the number of words in the review and puts it in a new column.

### 5. Instructor Do: Average Rating

* Our goal with this activity is to help students understand how to find the average of a column in PySpark. Show students how to find the average rating of the hotels in their portfolio.

### 6. Instructor Do: Remove Stop Words

* Our goal with this activity is to help students understand what stop words are and how to remove them from the review content.

### 7. Instructor Do: TD-IDF with HashingTF

* Our goal for this activity is to help students better understand the value in TD-IDF and how we can implement it for the hotel review dataset.
