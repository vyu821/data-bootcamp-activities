// @TODO: Complete the Following Steps

// Filter the list of cities to those with a population greater than 1,000,000.
// Calculate the density of bars per square mile (Area).
// Make a bar chart of bar density for cities with a population over 1,000,000

// 1. Use the filter method to create a custom filtering function
//  that returns the cities with a population greater than 1,000,000.

// 2. Use filter() to pass the function as its argument

// Check to make sure you filtered your cities correctly
// HINT: console.log() is your friend.

// 3. Use the map method with the arrow function to return all the filtered city names.

//  Check your filtered cities

// 4. Use the map method with the arrow function to return all the filtered city bar densities.
// HINT: You'll need to divide the number of bars by the area

//  Check the populations of your filtered cities

// 5. Create your trace.

// 6. Create the data array for our plot

// 7. Define our plot layout

// 8. Plot the chart to a div tag with id "bar-plot"
