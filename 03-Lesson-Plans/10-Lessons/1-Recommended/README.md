# Module 10: Virtual Class (Recommended) Lesson Plan (2hr)

## Overview 

Today's Virtual Class (Recommended) Session is an optional session to reinforce knowledge. We will use this session as an opportunity to dive deeper into concepts that may have been confusing for students the first time they learned them.

Today's session will be **Challenge Study Hall** that will be spent working on the latest challenge assignment. During these sessions, students can ask questions about concepts, share their screens to work together, and help each other debug their code. Encourage students to use this as a safe space to work through logic problems out loud and help each other. Note the importance of talking through their code, pair programming, and live coding.

Please be sure to not code the solution for the students, but to instead guide them to find their own solutions. 

## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this lesson, students should be able to...*

* Explain the requirements for the challenge assignment
* Develop a logical flow and pseudocode for the challenge assignment
* Determine appropriate course of action for the resolution of the challenge assignment

## Required Prep:

* **Review the challenge instructions** thoroughly to fully understand the requirements
* **Review the challenge solution file** thoroughly to fully understand one implemented version

**Set expectations for the session** by telling students that this is a group study session and they will have the opportunity to help each other debug their code and work through logic problems together. This is not a session where you will live code the assignment.

1. **Review the challenge instructions with your class.** Ask students to walk through the requirements logic as you pseudo code in comments, encouraging active participation from all. Use a flow chart if applicable to aid visual learners.
2. **Review the working challenge solution with your class.** Show students what the working assignment will look like. *Do not review the code with them.*
3. **Open the floor for questions.** Encourage students to talk about their bugs, share their screen, and work through the problems out loud. When students share their screen, encourage them to mute their notifications and use an incognito window as to not accidentally share personal information.
4. **Live code when relevant (using studentâ€™s assignments).** If you see an opportunity to help students cross the finish line, you can take the teaching opportunity to ensure everyone understands. Make sure to use code that students already have built and not the working solution code so you need less prep time in deconstructing portions of the code.

## Office Hours 

| Activity Time:       0:60 |  Elapsed Time:      1:00  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

The second hour of a Virtual Class (Recommended) Session is reserved for open-ended office hours, driven by students. Encourage participation by reminding them that this is their time to ask questions and get assistance from their instructional staff as theyâ€™re learning new concepts, so they should take full advantage of the time. 

Expect that students may ask for assistance such as the following: 

* Further review on a particular subject
* Debugging assistance
* Help with computer issues
* Guidance with a particular tool
