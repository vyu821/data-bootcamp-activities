# Train Test Split & Describe

## Instructions

* To develop and test our model we will need to separate our data into training and testing data. Additonally we should take this time explore our dataset statistically to determine if here are any relationships that will benefit our analysis.

* Use the starter notebook to perform a train test split of the udpated dataframe.

* Calculate the mean & std of the X_train dataset and identify any major differences between featueres.

* Hint: The describe() function can help calculate descriptive statistics regarding central tendency, dispersion, and distributions.

* Bonus: Create a pairplot to visualize the relationship between the following features from the original dataframe.

    * ['mpg', 'cylinders', 'displacement', 'weight', 'acceleration']
