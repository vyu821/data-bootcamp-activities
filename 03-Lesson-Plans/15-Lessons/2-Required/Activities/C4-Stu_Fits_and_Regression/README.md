# Fits and Regression

This activity gives students an opportunity to use Scipy to fit data and Matplotlib to display the fit.

## Instructions

* Open [crime.R](Unsolved/crime.R) file and execute the starter code. This starter code will import the dependencies you will need as well as load the FBI CIUS (Crime in the United States 20*) dataset.

* Generate a scatter plot with ggplot using the year as the independent (*x*) variable and the violent crime rate as the dependent (*y*) variable.

* Use `lm` to perform a linear regression with the year as the independent variable (*x*) and the violent crime rate as the dependent variable (*y*).

* Plot the linear model of year versus violent crime rate on top of your scatter plot.

  * **Hint**: Your scatter plot and line plot share the same axis.

  * **Hint**: In order to overlay plots in a notebook, the plots must be in the same code block.

* Repeat the process of generating a scatter plot, calculating the linear regression model, and plotting the regression line over the scatter plot for the following pairs of variables:

  * Year versus murder rate.

  * Year versus aggravated assault.
