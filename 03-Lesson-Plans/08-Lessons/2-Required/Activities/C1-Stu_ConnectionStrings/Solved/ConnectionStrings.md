# Solution

1. The six values are
    * Protocol: "postgres"
    * User: "postgres"
    * Password: "12345"
    * Location: "localhost"
    * Port: "5432"
    * Database: "pets"

2. Connection strings are URLs, but differ from website URLs by
    * Different protocol, i.e. "postgres" vs "http(s)"
    * Connection strings have user, password, and database, while website URLs do not
    * Website URLs have port 80 implied (but can use different ports, i.e. Jupyter Notebook)

3. The connection string is "mysql://admin:p@ssw0rd123@rds.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:3306/example"
