# Case Study

Skytrax User Reviews Dataset is data scraped from user reviews found on [Skytrax](www.airlinequality.com).

* [Airline Reviews](https://github.com/quankiquanki/skytrax-reviews-dataset/blob/master/data/airline.csv)

* [Airline Lounge Reviews](https://github.com/quankiquanki/skytrax-reviews-dataset/blob/master/data/lounge.csv)

The first dataset includes an incredible amount of detail regarding airline reviews. Each review is separate and not related to any other one.

The second dataset also includes an incredible amount of detail regarding airline lounge reviews. Each review is separate, but there may be more than one review for each lounge.

Today's class will be a case study where we have been hired as Tableau consultants for SnowCountry Airlines. They are a new airline based in Park City, Utah and desprately need help trying to figure out what their brand will do differently from other airlines. They have hired you to look through airline flight and lounge reviews to help them make better decisions.

### 1. Instructor Do: Importing Data in Tableau

* The goal of todays analysis is to create a comprehensive data visualization for SnowCountry Airlines using Tableau worksheets, dashboards, and stories.

### 2. Instructor Do: Joining Data in Tableau

* After importing the airline review dataset, the students will need to import the airline lounge dataset. That said, we will want to join that data together using Tableau.

### 3. Instructor Do: Creating Tableau Worksheets (Part 1)

* We'll start by creating a few worksheet to visualize our airline reviews.

### 4. Instructor Do: Creating Tableau Worksheets (Part 2)

* After creating the first few worksheets, we'll create a few more; focused on our airline lounge reviews.

### 5. Instructor Do: Creating Tableau Dashboards

* We now need to put together our worksheets into an easy to understand dashboard. Help students put their worksheets together in a meaningful way.

### 6. Instructor Do: Creating Tableau Stories (Part 1)

* Although the dashboard will be extremely valuable to SnowCountry Airlines, we also want to get in the habit of storytelling with our data. Create a story about what people like about certain airlines and lounges, as well as what they don't like.

### 7. Instructor Do: Sharing on Tableau Online

* Finally, we will share our stories and dashboards on Tableau Online.
