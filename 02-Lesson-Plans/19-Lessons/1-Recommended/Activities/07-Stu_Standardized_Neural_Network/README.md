# Standardized Neural Network

## Instructions

* With our scaled data we can create a basic neural network to test if our data preprocessing made a measurable difference. 

* Create a neural network to test the newly scaled data.

* Bonus: Try multiple different values for hidden nodes and epochs to see how they affect the results.
