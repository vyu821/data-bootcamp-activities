https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/overview

Zillowâ€™s Zestimate home valuation has shaken up the U.S. real estate industry since first released 11 years ago and are estimated based on statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property.

Todays class will be a case study where we work for NextHome Professionals, a Real Estate company, and would like to analyze Zillow data regarding home values and build our own statistical models to use alongside Zillow predicted results. 

Our dataset for this case study is a sample of homes from Orange County, California, where our firm is located. The dataset only includes locations with complete information for all of the fields we use in our analysis. 


### 1. Instructor Do: Running R

* The goal of todays analysis will be to import, clean, and analyze the dataset of home information using R to measure the prevelance and value of home features while attempting to  predict home values. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Reading CSVs

* To analyze our dataset and produce results we'll need to determine how we can bring the data into and R. 

### 3. Instructor Do: R Functions

* For our comapny to perform the analyses we'll develop today we need to create functions which can quickly and easily reperform our analyses in the future. The functions will then provide the results we can use to inform our company's decision making process. Let's create the struture of a main function we can pass our data to and perform our analyses.

### 4. Instructor Do: Tidyverse

* To analyze our data we will want to transform, group, and reshape our data. To do this we will leverage the power of the tidyverse libraries like dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. We'll perform exploratory data analysis using statistical summary functions and ploting multiples combinations of features to better understand our homes dataset.

### 5. Instructor Do: Correlation

* Now that we've performed our exploratory data analysis we'll want to determine if there are any patterns between different features of our dataset. These relationships are known as correlation and will help in our evaluation of features that will help us predict home prices. 

### 6. Instructor Do: Regression

* Last we'll use linear regression to predict what we believe the home values in our dataset could be. We can then compare our results to the Zillow values in our dataset to determine our level of accuracy. We'll first trying creating our predictions with a single varaible and compare the results to a multivariable model.
