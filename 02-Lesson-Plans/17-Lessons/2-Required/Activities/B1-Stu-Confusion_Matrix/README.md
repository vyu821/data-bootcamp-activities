# Confusion Matrix

## Instructions

You run a clinical trial for a cancer screening test, and obtain the following confusion matrix:

|          | Predicted + | Predicted - |
|----------|:-------------:|----------:|
| Actual + |      50       |    0      |
| Actual - |      4        |    1      |

1. How many of the following are there in this study? TP, FP, TN, FN

2. Calculate the precision.

3. Calculate the recall.
