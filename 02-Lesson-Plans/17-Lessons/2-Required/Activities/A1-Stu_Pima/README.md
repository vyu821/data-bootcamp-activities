# Sci-kit Learn Model Syntax

* In this activity, you will compare the performance of four classifiers using the Pima Diabetest dataset.

## Instructions

### Part I

* Import the Pima Diabetes dataset and prepare a train/test split with `Outcome` as the target variable.

### Part II

* Train a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the diabetes label. Print the score for the trained model using the test data.

### Part III

* Repeat the exercise in Part II with a Decision Tree classifier. Compare the score to the Logistic Regression.

### Part IV

* Train a Random Forest classifier to predict the diabetes label. Print the score for the trained model using the test data.

* BONUS: Experiment with different numbers of estimators in your random forest model. Try different values between 100 and 1000 and compare the scores.

### Part V

* Finally, train a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict the diabetes label. Print the score for the trained model.

* BONUS: Experiment with different values for `C` and `gamma` in your support vector machine model. Note: high values for `C` (above 10) may take much longer to run.
