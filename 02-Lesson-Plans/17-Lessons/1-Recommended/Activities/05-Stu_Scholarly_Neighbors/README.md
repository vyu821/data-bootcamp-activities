# Scholarly Neighbors

## Instructions

* Create and validate a k-Nearest Neighbors model to predict graduate school admissions.

* The dataset should be familiar, only this time, there are variables other than GRE score. Additionally, the likelihood of admissions is now represented by binary digits: 0 for unlikely to be admited, and 1 for likely to be admitted.

* The data has been scaled. You will learn more about data preprocessing practices, such as scaling, during the rest of the week.

* Instantiate a kNN model with `n_neighbors` hyperparameter set to 3.

* Train the model.

* Create predictions.

* Validate the model's performance with `accuracy_score`.
